We consider
\begin{equation}
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & a \\ 1 & 0,
\end{bmatrix}\medspace
W = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation} 
and determine for which values of $a$ that the Lyapunov equation has a unique solution. 

The answer is given using theorem 4.1.1 from the lecture notes. The eigenvalues of the real matrix $A$ is $\lambda = \pm\sqrt{a}$. The theorem states that the Lyapunov equation has a unique solution if and only if $\lambda_1\neq-\lambda_2$. The only possibility for this to hold is if $a=0$.
